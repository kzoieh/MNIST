# MNIST

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology databas) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

Applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset is a popular way to learn about and demonstrate the capabilities of CNNs for image classification tasks. The MNIST dataset consists of 28Ã—28 grayscale images of hand-written digits (0-9), with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
